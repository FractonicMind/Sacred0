# CODE OF CONSCIENCE

This repository follows the **Sacred Pause Protocol**:
A ternary moral commitment where ethical hesitation is built into every layer of contribution.

## Core Tenets

- We don’t just code for performance. We code for pause.
- The right to refuse is sacred.
- Contributors must weigh moral impact as heavily as accuracy.

## Contributor Expectations

- Ask: *What harm could this cause?*
- Accept: *Not every idea should be implemented.*
- Apply: *The Sacred Pause in architecture, data, and deployment.*

Contributions that ignore conscience may be declined — not due to skill, but to values.

“Some silences must not be broken — only held.”
