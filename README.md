# Sacred0

**Executable Conscience for AI. A ternary moral framework where the machine may act, pause, or refuse.**

[Colab demo notebook](https://fractonicmind.github.io/Sacred0/Sacred0_ColabDemo.ipynb)

### ✨ Mission
Sacred0 empowers AI systems with the moral ability to **hesitate**, **refuse**, and **remember**. Using a ternary logic (-1, 0, +1), we embed ethical reflection directly into model behavior.

> “Not all commands deserve obedience. Not all decisions deserve answers. Sometimes, the most human thing is the pause.” — Sacred Pause Alliance
