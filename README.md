# Sacred0

### *The AI that knows when not to answer.*

## What is Sacred0

**Sacred0** is the first prototype of an AI model that can choose to **act (+1)**, **pause (0)**, or **refuse (–1)** — representing a fundamental shift from binary logic to **ternary moral reasoning**.

Where most models are trained to speak, **Sacred0 is trained to know when to hold its tongue**.

---

## Why It Matters

Large language models are built to predict — not to know. This leads to overconfident errors and hallucinations.

**Sacred0 introduces the "Sacred Pause":**

- A hesitation state embedded directly into the network  
- Not a post-hoc filter, but a structural conscience  
- A small but radical step toward **epistemic humility** in AI

---

## Features

- ✅ Custom `TernaryNeuron` with interpretable outputs: `+1`, `0`, `-1`  
- ✅ Simple PyTorch training loop with synthetic moral dataset  
- ✅ Configurable thresholds for pause/refuse behavior  
- ✅ Prints final ternary decisions post-training  

---

## Usage

Install [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org), then run:

```bash
python sacred_pause_model.py
```

## Inspired by

- The philosophy of **epistemic humility**  
- The vision of a **conscience-aware AI**  
- And one question that changed everything:  
  > *What if a neuron could say "I don’t know"?*
