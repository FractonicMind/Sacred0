## ✨ Mission

Sacred0 empowers AI systems with the moral ability to **hesitate**, **refuse**, and **remember**.  
Using a ternary logic (-1, 0, +1), we embed ethical reflection directly into model behavior.

> “Not all commands deserve obedience. Not all decisions deserve answers.  
> Sometimes, the most human thing is the pause.” — Sacred Pause Alliance
