# SacredPause-AI: Overview

SacredPause-AI is a research prototype for building AI models that can **pause**, **refuse**, or **act** â€” introducing ternary moral reasoning into neural networks.

## Project Goal
To create a PyTorch-based model that can make ternary decisions:
- **+1**: Take Action
- ** 0**: Pause / Hesitate
- **-1**: Refuse to Act

The project implements a minimal custom neuron and trains on synthetic moral scenarios.
