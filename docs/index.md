# Welcome to Sacred0

## What is Sacred0?

Sacred0 is a ternary moral AI framework — a system designed not to always answer, but to sometimes pause or refuse.

It is the first model to embed the **Sacred Pause** directly into its logic. Instead of binary "yes/no", Sacred0 considers:

- **+1** — Act
- **0** — Pause
- **–1** — Refuse

## How to Use This Repo

Start with the [Colab demo notebook](../Sacred0_ColabDemo.ipynb). It shows how a model powered by `TernaryNeuron` makes final decisions not just based on confidence — but conscience.

## Learn the Philosophy

Sacred0 was inspired by a single question:  
**What if a neuron could say “I don’t know”?**
